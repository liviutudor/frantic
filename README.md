Frantic WordPress theme

This is based on the [Frantic WordPress theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/frantic/) but adds some more improvements.

Please see [my blog post about the Frantic theme](http://liviutudor.com/2016/03/20/frantic-wordpress-theme-update/) which describes the changes made to this theme.

Sidebars
========

This adds the following new sidebars to the theme:

* Footer left
* Footer middle
* Footer right

They will appear as 3 columns at the bottom of the screen, under the main "table".
